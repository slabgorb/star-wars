// SH2-13 RED — the dependency-pin contract: star-wars must consume
// @arcade/shared at a ref whose exports map carries the /name-entry subpath
// (the shared keyboard initials-entry reducer). The current pin (v0.7.0)
// predates the module, so this fails until Dev re-pins to the tag that ships
// it.
//
// Isolated in its own file, and imported through a VARIABLE specifier with
// @vite-ignore, so the unresolvable subpath surfaces as this one test's
// failure — not a module-graph crash that would silence sibling tests (the
// SH2-5/SH2-6 precedent).
